# CRM for Raising Capital

This is the greatest CRM for raising capital. It's just fantastic. Everybody says so.

## Features

- Schedules emails. It's like having your own personal assistant. But better. Because it's a machine. And machines are great. They're just great.
- Asks for temperature and maximum tokens only once. Because who has time to keep entering the same thing over and over again? Not me. Not you. Not anyone.
- Logs investor responses. Because you need to know who's in and who's out. It's like The Apprentice, but for investors.
- Auto reply to all replies. If they say something that sounds like a yes, it sends a thank you note and a Calendly link. It's like having your own personal secretary. But better. Because it's a machine. And machines are great. They're just great.
